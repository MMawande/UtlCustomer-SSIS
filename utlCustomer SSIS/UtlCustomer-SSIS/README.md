In Data flow we do ETL activities while in control flow we do NON-ETL activities. FOR LOOP is a NON-ETL activity and has to be done in control flow

	- For loop, Variables , parameters and debugging

There are two types of for loops (Foreach Loop Container & For loop container)

For loop container do a loop up until a fixed count 
For each container loops through a (collection) items like recordset, files in a folder and so on

Control flow pass full file name with the path to the data flow ? It is through using variables 

Variables are temporary storages where we can go and store some values
